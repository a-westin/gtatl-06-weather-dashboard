# Weather Dashboard

 ## Description  

  A browser-based application that utilizes jQuery, moment.js, and the OpenWeather API in order to allow a user to search for the weather conditions of a particular city. Visit the deployed application [here.](https://a-westin.github.io/gtatl-06-weather-dashboard/)

  ### Usage
  
  When the user visits the deployed site, they are brought to a landing screen that allows them to search for a particular city, either domestic or international. If the search term is invalid, an error message with display and prompt the user to try their search again. If the city is found successfully, the user will be shown the current conditions for said city, as well as a five day forecast. 
  
  One of the objectives of this application was also to be able to all the searched cities to persist, but I have had trouble with getting the searches to display on screen as well as to save to local storage. Hopefully with further troubleshooting, I will be able to successfully debug the code.
